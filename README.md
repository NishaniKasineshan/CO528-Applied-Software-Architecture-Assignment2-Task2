Tasks

Create an angle selector.

* It must have a text box, starting at 0. The text box should show a value between 0 and 360. Users should be able to type any numeric value in the text box, it should update to a value between 0 to 360.

* It must have a slider. When the text shows 0 (eg, at the start) the slider must be in the middle. Any value between 0 to 360 should be selectable using the slider.

* A set of 5 radio buttons should be there to select common values (0, 45, 60, 90, 180).The slider, radio buttons and text box should be in sync (eg: the radio button must be selected if the corresponding value is entered using the text box)

Create the above using React.
